\item{numTrees}{Integer | Number of trees of the Random Forest model. Default value: 100.}

\item{mtry}{Integer | Number of predictors that are evaluated at each partition (node) of each tree. Default value: 225.}

\description{
Methodology based on the combination of a genetic algorithm and a Machine Learning technique to mutate the final
diagnosis of patients, detecting anomalies in them.
}
\details{
These discrepancies may have their origin in the evolution of the subject itself, leading it from one group to
another in biological terms, or they may derive from human error in the labelling of the samples, among other causes.

The identification and correction of these erroneous situations becomes essential to preserve the integrity
and accuracy of the data.
